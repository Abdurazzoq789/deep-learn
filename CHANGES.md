# RealTimeSpeechModal Component Changes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Text Display Issue**
   - Fixed the websocket message handling to properly display both user and bot messages
   - Added proper role detection from websocket messages
   - Improved error handling for message parsing

2. **Audio Playback Issue**
   - Replaced the browser's SpeechSynthesis API with an HTML Audio element
   - Added proper audio initialization and event handling
   - Set up the audio to play from the TTS API endpoint
   - Added error handling for audio playback

3. **Video Integration**
   - Added two video elements:
     - `speaking.mp4`: Shows a person speaking when the bot is talking
     - `waiting.mp4`: Shows a silent person when the bot is not talking
   - Implemented logic to switch between videos based on the bot's speaking state
   - Added proper video initialization and event handling

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Created a two-column layout with videos on the left and conversation on the right
   - Redesigned the conversation display to look more like a chat interface
   - Added different styling for user and bot messages
   - Improved the visual design with better spacing, shadows, and rounded corners
   - Made the UI responsive for different screen sizes
   - Added a status indicator to show whether the bot is speaking or listening
   - Improved the recording controls with better styling

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **State Management**
   - Added `botSpeaking` state to track whether the bot is currently speaking
   - Used this state to control which video is displayed

2. **Refs for Media Elements**
   - Added refs for audio and video elements:
     - `audioRef`: For the audio element that plays the bot's speech
     - `speakingVideoRef`: For the video of a person speaking
     - `waitingVideoRef`: For the video of a silent person

3. **Event Handling**
   - Set up event handlers for audio playback:
     - `onplay`: Sets `botSpeaking` to true
     - `onended`: Sets `botSpeaking` to false
     - `onerror`: Handles audio playback errors

4. **Video Switching Logic**
   - Implemented an effect that switches between videos based on the `botSpeaking` state
   - When the bot starts speaking, the speaking video plays and the waiting video pauses
   - When the bot stops speaking, the waiting video plays and the speaking video pauses

5. **Websocket Message Handling**
   - Improved the logic to correctly identify and process both user and bot messages
   - Added better error handling for websocket communication

## Usage

The component works the same way as before from a user perspective, but now provides a much better experience:

1. Click "Start Recording" to begin speaking
2. Your speech will be transcribed and displayed in the conversation
3. The bot will respond with text and audio
4. The video will show a person speaking when the bot is talking
5. The UI now looks more like a real conversation with a person

1. **Advanced Audio Loading System with Retries**
   - Implemented a comprehensive retry mechanism that attempts to load audio up to 4 times total
   - Added different strategies for each retry attempt:
     - First retry: Uses alternative CORS settings ('use-credentials')

   - Preserved all UI state indicators to provide feedback on speech status

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the RealTimeSpeechModal component, check the following:

1. **Message Display Issues**
   - Open the browser console to view the detailed message logs
   - Verify that WebSocket messages are being received
   - Check the message format to ensure it contains the expected fields

2. **Audio Playback Issues**
   - Ensure the TTS API endpoint is accessible
   - Check for CORS issues in the browser console
   - Verify that the audio element is properly initialized

3. **Video Switching Issues**
   - Ensure the video files exist at the correct paths
   - Check for video loading errors in the browser console
   - Verify that the botSpeaking state is changing correctly

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Adding more realistic video transitions
- Implementing lip-sync for the speaking video
